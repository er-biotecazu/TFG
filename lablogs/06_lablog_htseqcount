##VARIABLES

#All the BAM/SAM files from the different conditions are present in this current folder
#--idattr locus_tag (because my annotations file does not have gene_id feature with the name of the gene)
#-s no  because it is unstranded (see documentation for more information). Because of this, a read is considered overlapping  with  a  feature  regardless  of whether  it  is  mapped  to  the  same  or the opposite strand as the feature.
#-r pos because reads are ordered by position, not by name (_SortedByCoordinate_)
#-f bam because we are taking BAM files
#
#-t exon because the feature we are taking (in the third column of the GFF file) is exon.
#-m union because that is the mode we select to handle reads overlapping more than one feature

## We define output pathway and the names of the samples. 
RUN_PATH_O=/home/erict/my_files_eric/Ct_nuevo/RNA-seq/03-htseqcount/htseq_results
names_samples=($(cat /home/erict/my_files_eric/Ct_nuevo/RNA-seq/00-raw_reads/samples_id.txt))

## We perform the analysis
